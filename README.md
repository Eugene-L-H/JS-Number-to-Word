# JS-Number-To-Word

This function will print to the console the text value of the number
provided by the user in the first parameter.

  The second parameter dictates where the function will count from. The default
value of the second parameter will match the value of the first parameter if no other
value is entered.

# Notes
This was a very challenging, yet fun, project to develop. It sprung from a
thought, to an experiment, and finally into something that worked.
